# Raw—Data-analyzer
 The program calculates the mode, mean, medium and range of data. It also list all data from small to big.
Advantage: The input is simple: you only need to input all raw data in and end with input -1. You don’t even need to input the amount.
Disadvantage: The program can only process integer data from 0 to 100000. This is because the program used indexing from list to represent data value.
